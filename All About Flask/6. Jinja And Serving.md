## Rendering
In order to return just an html tag with a little text, we can return that string value.
`return '<h1>Content</h1>'`
If we wanted to return an entire webpage, we could write out the entire page as a very large string. This can be incredibly complicated. Instead, we can use the `Jinja` package.

## What is Jinja?
Jinja is a dependency for Flask that helps to render html templates in our web application. Templates make serving html easier by writing out predefined html files that we can pass values into and modify. Without templates, we would have to serve html to Flask by writing it all out manually in a large string.
