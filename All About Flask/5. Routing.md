## Handling Routes
Routes in flask are handled by decorators and functions. The decorator is called upon the app, takes in a path as a string, and wraps itself around a following function. The contents of the function will determine what we do, and what is returned. The return value will usually be html, in the form of a string.
`@app.route('/path')`

By chaining decorators, several routes can share the same actions. Useful for when we have multiple pages that do the same thing or lead to the same place.
```py
@app.route('/')
@app.route('/home')
def home():
	do_stuff()
	return 'html'
```
*It's good practice to make the name of the function match the functionality or path of decorator*

There are additional decorators that add additional functionality.
`@app.before_request` runs code before the request goes through
	This is useful for establishing database connections or logging in users
`@app.before_first_request` runs code before the very first request is made
	This is good for initializing the application
`@app.after_request` runs code after the request has completed and a response is made.
	This is useful for closing database connections.
	The function following this ***must*** take in a response as a parameter, and ***must*** return a response as well.
## Route Parameters
Within a path, we can also define a route parameter. The route parameter will allow different data to be displayed in a uniform manner on the style of same page.
To use a parameter, add an id to the end of the path with angled brackets.
`@app.route('/hello/<name>'`
And then pass that same parameter name into the function parameter list for use
```py
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello_name(name):
	return f"<h1>Hello {name}<h1>"
```

For added security and error handling, flask allows us to type cast the parameter within the path by adding the expected class inside the angled brackets. Type casting the parameter tells flask to only accept requests with parameters that match the type. *There can be no space between the cast and the parameter*

A request to `@app.route('/users/<int:id>')` as `/path/23` will work fine. But a request to `/path/Bob` would throw a 404 error (not found) since Bob cannot be parsed to an int, and that page wouldn't exist.

## Putting it all together
```py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
@app.route('/home')
def home():
	return '<h1>Welcome</h1>'

@app.route(/hello)
@app.route('/hello/<name>')
def hello(name=None):
	if name:
		return f'<h1>Hello, {name}</h1>'
	else:
		return '<h1>Hello, user</h1>'
```
