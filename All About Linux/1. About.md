## What is Linux?
Like Windows or Mac, Linux is an Operating System. The Operating system is what bridges computer hardware and computer software.

Linux is an open source OS. There are many different versions - or *distributions* of Linux OS. All Linux commands work the same across all distributions. All Linux distributions are built upon the Unix framework.

Windows has some compatibility with Linux through *WSL* - Windows Subsystem for Linux. This let sus run linux commands from a terminal.

## Shells
There are several different terminal interfaces when using Linux. (bash, zsh, sh) They come with slight differences. Just know which you are working with.
