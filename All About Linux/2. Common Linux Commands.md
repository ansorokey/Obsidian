## Closing and Quitting
The most standard way to close out of any linux command line, or to end a Linux process is `ctrl+c`

## `ls`
Used to view the contents (files and directories) within the current directory.
- Can be given a path (relative or absolute) `ls ../Documents`
- can be given the `-l` flag for columned information `ls -l`
- can be given the `-a` flag to view hidden files `ls -a`
- `ls -al ../Documents/AppAcademy/Week`
## `cd`
Used to change the current directory
- can be given an absolute or relative path (absolute will begin with `/`)
- can be given nothing to return to home directory
- `tab` to auto complete directory names

## `pwd`
Used to display the current directory 

## `echo`
Just a terminal print command.
 Mostly used to display the values of OS environment variables
- `echo $PATH`, `echo $SHELL`, etc

## `ps`
Used to display the currently running process.
- the `-a` flag shows processes run by all users
- the `-x` flag includes processes not being run through a terminal
- the `-u` flag provides additional details
- can be combined together `ps -aux`

## `less` and `more`
Used to view the contents of a file, little difference between them besides arrow key controls
- `less readme.md`

## Piping
The `|` character is used to chain commands together. The data from the first command is sent to the second command.
- `ls -la /usr/local/bin | less` turns an ls list into pages

## `cat`
Used to view the contents of a file without pages
- `cat file.ext`
- Literally *concatenate*, can list several files and combine them into a single one
- Use one `>` to replace or create data
- Use two `>>` to append to the end
- `cat file1.txt file2.text > new-file.txt`

## `tail`
Used to display the last lines of a file
- can be passes an integer to view the last x files `tail -3 readme.md`
- can be passed the `-f` flag to follow changes

## `vi` and `vim`
Linux based text editors, run entirely with the keyboard. Is sometimes the editor opened when performing a merge in git
- `/search-here` to search for text
- `i` to insert (while in insert, `del` deletes characters)
- `o` to create new line with insert
- `x` to delete character
- `dd` to delete a line
- `G` to go the end of file
- `:` + characters for commands
- `:w` write to file, or save
- `:qa` to exit
- `wq` to save and exit
- `:q!` to close without saving

## `nano`
Another terminal text editor, with more focus on `ctrl` commands
- `ctrl+x` to close editor

## `grep`
Used to find text in a file or directory without opening the file
- `grep text file.txt`
- put longer phrases or stuff with spaces in double quotes `grep "longer text" file.txt`
- Use `-R` to search recursively `grep text -R /directory`
- Can be combined with piping `grep sql readme.md | less`
## `find`
Mostly used to find files. Returns a command list of those file locations
`find directory/path -name "name of file with extension"`
- can also make use of wildcards `find . -name ".md"`
- can make the filename case insensitive with `-iname`

## `chown`
Changes the ownerships and groups of files or directories
`chown owning-user:owning-group file.txt`
- can add the `-R` flag to change everything within a directory

## `chmod`
Changes the read, write, and execute permissions of files and directories
---- indicate the file type and permission
- d--- is a directory
- -r-- means read permissions
- --w- means write permissions
- ---x means execute permissions
- Repeated three times for each set of permissions
- In order: user, group, system users
- A directory must be executable to cd into it
`chmod +x file.txt add write permissions`
`chmod 600 file.txt` gives only the owner full permissions (or access) to a file

## Help
There are many different built in ways to see what we can use with commands. 
- `man COMMAND`
- `COMMAND -h`
- `COMMAND --help`
## Package Managers
Every distribution of Linux makes use of a package manager to manage what is installed on a Linux system.
- apt, yum, apk
