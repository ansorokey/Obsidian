The purpose of an ORM is to connect and translate the contents and actions in a database to our local programming language. SQLAlchemy allows us to modify the database and perform SQL commands using the Python language.

To manage data in the database, one of the steps we must take is translate the schema of tables into Python classes. This is referred to as *mapping*, and the classes we create to represent tables are *models*. While there are two types of SQLAlchemy mapping, we will almost always only use *declarative* mapping.

## Creating models
During set up of SQLAlchemy in flask, we previously created a `models.py` file within our app directory. This is where classes will be created.

*KEY NOTE*
All the classes we create will be inheriting or extending a base class.
One of the base classes it could inherit is the `declarative_base` class. It would be done like so:
```py
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative_base import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class NewClass(Base):
	......
```
While this is perfectly fine, we will instead be using the `db.Model` approach we saw in earlier set up. Under the hood, `db.Model` is also using a declarative base, so they serve the same purpose. `db.Model` as a base class, however, comes with the added benefit of easier querying. It allows us to query directly off the model, rather than having to query off the session, as we will see later. 
Other than this, they are exactly the same.
