The purpose of an ORM is to connect and translate the contents and actions in a database to our local programming language. SQLAlchemy allows us to modify the database and perform SQL commands using the Python language.

To manage data in the database, one of the steps we must take is translate the schema of tables into Python classes. This is referred to as *mapping*, and the classes we create to represent tables are *models*. While there are two types of SQLAlchemy mapping, we will almost always only use *declarative* mapping.

## Creating models
During set up of SQLAlchemy in flask, we previously created a `models.py` file within our app directory. This is where classes will be created.

*KEY NOTE*
All the classes we create will be inheriting or extending a base class.
One of the base classes it could inherit is the `declarative_base` class. It would be done like so:
```py
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative_base import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class NewClass(Base):
	......
```
While this is perfectly fine, we will instead be using the `db.Model` approach we saw in earlier set up. Under the hood, `db.Model` is also using a declarative base, so they serve the same purpose. `db.Model` as a base class, however, comes with the added benefit of easier querying. It allows us to query directly off the model, rather than having to query off the session, as we will see later. 
Other than this, they are exactly the same.
Every model should be given an explicit table name using the same dunder for the sake of clarity
```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class NewClass(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'new_classes'
```
*Singlular CapitalCase model name*
*plural snake_case table name*
### Creating columns
To match the columns in a sql table, we can give our class properties. The properties we name them should match the same column names in the sql table.
To make a column for our class, we'll use the `Column` constructor. This can be imported or called from the `db`
```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.schema import Column
db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'users'
	id = Column()

class Character(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'characters'
	id = db.Column()
```

The `Column` constructor will take in several additional constraint values, including the data type, value constraints, null, primary keys, foreign keys, etc
The data type is declared with a wrapper that needs to be imported, or called from the database. Types like a string can be given an additional
```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.schema import Column
from sqlalchemy.types import Integer, String, Float
db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'users'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	username = Column(String(30), nullable=False, unique=true)

class Character(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'characters'
	id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	character_name = db.Column(db.String(30), nullable=False)
```

### Relationships between classes
Recall that we can relate the data in tables to one another using primary and foreign keys
- one to one
- one to many
- many to many

Declaring the primary key on a column is as simple as adding it as a constraint to a column.
Creating a foreign key is similar, but will need an imported wrapper, which gets passed in a string of the table name and column name ForeignKey('table.col')
```
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.schema import Column, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.types import Integer, String, Float
db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'users'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	username = Column(String(30), nullable=False, unique=true)

class Character(db.Model):
	__tablename__ = 'characters'
	id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
	character_name = db.Column(db.String(30), nullable=False)
	user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('users.id'), nullable=False)
```
	*ONLY the defined Columns appear in the database. Any other properties in the class arre for us. The relationship will not appear in the database. We could also define custom class methods, like a __repr__()*
```py
class Dog(db.Model):
	# Attributes that show up in the database
	id = Column(...)
	name = Column(...)
	age = Column(..)
	tricks = Column(...)

	# Properties and functions only available on the instance
	toys = relationship('Toy', back_populates('dog'))
	def __repr__(self):
		return f'Whatever we want to say about the dog and its data'
	def to_dict(self):
		return {
			'property': self.property,
			'property2': len(property2),
			...
		}
```
Adding the to_dict method to a class is very useful for returning json data through flask. Consider naming the dictionary keys in camelcase in advanced.
Keep in mind that the instances returned through associations are class instances, which cannot be parsed into json.
Instead, call that class's to_dict method so it can become json
#### Associations
A normal relationship on a class or between tables simply references the primary key of that table. it does not give us any more information than what may be just the id. 
With data related to one another, we can create attributes on the class. When queried, it will come with all the data it is associated with/related to as the defined attribute.
This will be handled with the relationship constructor, imported from the .orm package of sqlalchemy `descriptive_name = relationship('ModelToAssociate', back_populates=otherDescriptiveName)`
```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.schema import Column, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.types import Integer, String, Float
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
db = SQLAlchemy()

class Author(db.model):
	__tablename__ = 'Authors'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)

	# The useList is only used on the many side of a one ot many relationship
	# This simply returns the data as a single record, rather than a list
	books = relationship('Books', back_populates='author', useList=False)
	
class Book(db.model):
	__tablename__ = 'Books'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	title = Column(String(50), nullable=False)

	author = relationship('Author', back_populates='books')
```
The power of a relationship allows us to add one record to another, and have the unadded record fill itself out.
In the example above, if we only added a book to an author, the back_populates will add the author to the book as well (associated creation/update)
By adding `cascade='all, delete'` to to the relationship, we can also have them dynamically cascade delete if the main data disappears.

A many to many relationship takes several tables that relate to one another and place them as a single record within one join table. A similar approach will be used for join tables in sqlalchemy.
Rather the defining a class, we will instead add columns and some other data to a `Table` constructor, passing in: `table_name`, `db.Model.metadata`, `col('tablename', Type, ForeignKey('tablename.id'), primary_key=True)`, `col`
```py
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.schema import Column, ForeignKey, Table
from sqlalchemy.types import Integer, String, Float
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
db = SQLAlchemy()

orderItems = Table(
	'order_items',
	db.Model.metadata,
	Column('orders', Integer, ForeignKey('orders.id'), primary_key=True),
	Column('items', Integer, ForeignKey('items.id'), primary_key=True),
)

class Order(db.model):
	__tablename__ = 'orders'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	items = relationship('Item', secondary=orderItems, back_populates='orders', cascade='all, delete')
	
class Item(db.model):
	__tablename__ = 'items'
	id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
	orders = relationship('Order', secondary=orderItems, back_populates='items', cascade='all, delete')
```
This does create a table in the database, but this table isnt really meant for querying. We can also decide to add more attributes and make it its own class with several foreign keys.
