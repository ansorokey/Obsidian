We'll need to get a SQLAlchemy project set up in order to use it. Start by creating a new directory to act as the root of our project.

Next, we need to install using pipenv. We will need to be in our virtual environment.
`pipenv install sqlalchemy`
`pipenv shell`

Within the root of our project, we'll need a database file. We can create one manually:
`touch dev.db`
or create one as we populate the database by opening sqlite3
`sqlite3 dev.db`

If we don't want to run the commands to populate by hand, we can instead create a .SQL file, and read it from within our database.
`touch seed.sql`
`sqlite3 dev.db`
`.read seed.sql`

The next example will use
