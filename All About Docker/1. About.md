## What is Docker?
Docker is a program that allows us to run *containers*. The purpose of a container is to package up all the dependencies, libraries, code, system tools, and more needed to run an application. A container only uses the resources it needs and is run by the computer's kernel.

## Parts of Docker

### The Docker Engine
The docker engine is like the 'brain' of docker, responsible for running each process in a separate, isolated environment. Its made up of the core container applications and a restful HTTP API for interaction with the *daemon*: which manages docker objects (images, containers, networks, and volumes)

### Dockerfile
The dockerfile is composed of *images*. Each container is built upon an image.
A docker image is the collection of dependencies an application needs to run. Dockerfiles get converted into images by the *build system*


### Docker Hub
Just like git hub, this is an online, remote registry for the pushing and pulling of docker images through the Docker CLI.

### Docker Compose
Docker compose is a tool for managing multi-container docker applications. These are the applications that depend on one another to run.
These are configured using *YAML* files. (Like Json for human readbility)

### Docker Swarm
Docker compose manages multiple containers in a single host.
Docker swarm manages multiple hosts running their own containers.
