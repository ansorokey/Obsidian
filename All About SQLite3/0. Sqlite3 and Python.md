## Opening and closing a connection
Python has a few ways of starting and ending a connection. A *connection* in this case can include opening a file, or accessing a database.
The most basic way of doing so is with a try block.
```py
f = None
try:
    f = open('some_file.txt')
    # do stuff with f like read the file
finally:
    if f:
      f.close()
```
A variable `f` is initialized to represent the connection (here, the file)
We then `try` to open a local file. We try this because the file may not exist, or may be inaccessible. If it can not be accessed, we cannot perform further actions.
The finally - which *will* run no matter what, then checks to see if we were able to access the file. Only if we accessed it do we need to close it and end the connection.
