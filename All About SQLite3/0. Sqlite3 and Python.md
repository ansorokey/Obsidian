## Opening and closing a connection
Python has a few ways of starting and ending a connection. A *connection* in this case can include opening a file, or accessing a database.
The most basic way of doing so is with a try block.
```py
f = None
try:
    f = open('some_file.txt')
    # do stuff with f like read the file
finally:
    if f:
      f.close()
```
A variable `f` is initialized to represent the connection (here, the file)
We then `try` to open a local file. We try this because the file may not exist, or may be inaccessible. If it can not be accessed, we cannot perform further actions.
The finally - which *will* run no matter what, then checks to see if we were able to access the file. Only if we accessed it do we need to close it and end the connection.

## The With Keyword
The try block can now be replaced with a simple keyword: `with`. The with acts as the opener and closer for a connection.
```py
# with FILE_ACCESS as FILE_VARAIBLE
with open('some_file.txt') as f:
	# do stufff with f
```
Above, `f` is now scoped to the code block alone, so we do not need to declare it and reassign it. This means we could also reuse the `f` variable elsewhere.
### With Sqlite3
The with keyword makes establishing a database connection much cleaner and easier. We call the connect method on sqlite, and then assign it to our context manager (a variable)
Within the connection, we'll create another variable that does the interactions inside the database.
```py
with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
    curs = conn.cursor()
    curs.execute(CREATE_USERS_TABLE_SQL)
```
