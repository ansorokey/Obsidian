## Set up 
### Import
Sqlite3 is a built-in package for Python. There is no need to install. We only need to import.
`import sqlite3`

When working with sqlite3, we will have a dedicated database file somewhere within the project to hold all data and tables. 
The location of this file is usually stored within the .env file.
`DB_FILE=dev.db`

Next, we need to open a connection to the sqlite3 database. We will do so using the [[4. The With Block|with]] keyword

### Connecting
The with keyword makes establishing a database connection much cleaner and easier. We call the connect method on sqlite3, pass in the DB_FILE, and then assign it to a variable using `as`.
Within the connection, we'll create another variable that does the interactions inside the database.
```py
with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
    curs = conn.cursor()
    curs.execute(CREATE_USERS_TABLE_SQL)
```
- `conn` refers to the connection from flask/Python to the database
- `curs` is the cursor object that allows us to interact with the contents of the database and perform actions.
- Calling `execute()` on curs allows us to run a SQL command as we would on the command line.

## Running SQL commands
With the connection established, we can now run SQL commands through Python.
```py
with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
    curs = conn.cursor()
    curs.execute("SELECT 'Hello World!'")
    result = curs.fetchone()
    print(result) # ('Hello World!',)
```
Results from the database will be returned in tuples.

The `fetch` method determines how many results to return from the query.
- `curs.fetchone()` will return a single result 
- `curs.fetchall()` will return an entire list
```py
with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
    curs = conn.cursor()
    curs.execute('SELECT manu_year, make, model FROM cars;')
    cars = curs.fetchall()
    for car in cars:
        print(car)
        # (1993, 'Mazda', 'Rx7')
        # (1995, 'Mitsubishi', 'Eclipse')
        # (1994, 'Acura', 'Integra')
```

## Parameterized SQL commands

All the code above can be placed inside of and run as a function. This means we can also pass in variables that change what will be queried and how.
### A plain function
```py
def print_all_cars():
    with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
        curs = conn.cursor()
        curs.execute('SELECT manu_year, make, model, owner_id FROM cars;')
        cars = curs.fetchall()
        for car in cars:
            print(car)  
                print(car)  
            print(car)  


print_all_cars()
# (1993, 'Mazda', 'Rx7', 1)
# (1995, 'Mitsubishi', 'Eclipse', 2)
# (1994, 'Acura', 'Integra', 3)
```

### With parameters
```py
def get_owners_cars(owner_id):
    with sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE) as conn:
        curs = conn.cursor()
        curs.execute("""
                     SELECT manu_year, make, model FROM cars
                     WHERE owner_id = :owner_id
                     """,
                     {'owner_id': owner_id})
        results = curs.fetchall()
        return results

print(get_owners_cars(1)) # [(1993, 'Mazda', 'Rx7')]
```
When using a parameter with SQL, the parameter must be prepended with a colon `:`
The parameters used are not read from the arguments passed in. Instead, we must add a python dictionary after the sql statement that maps the key-value pairs to their parameter, with a string as they key and the function parameter as the value.

## Data Conversions
SQL and Python do not have the exact same data types. So when working with both, keep in mind how they will alter data types to stay functional.
```
SQLite3	  Python
NULL	  None
INTEGER	  int
REAL	  float
TEXT	  str
BLOB	  bytes
```
