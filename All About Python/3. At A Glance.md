print('Hello World')
print(1 < 2)
print('Students: ', students)
```

## Comments
```py
# A single hash in front of a line is a comment 
"""
This is technically a multiline string

Double Quotes for comments.

==, <, <=, >, >=, !=
```

## Code Blocks
```py
# two spaces
if x:
  y
  
# Single indent
for y in x:
	z
```

## Function Declaration
```py
# Standard 
def func_name(params):
	return result

# lambda (anonymous one liner)
lambda param: param += 5
```

## Logic Operators 
```py
x and x
x or y
x and not y
x or not y
not (x and y)
```

`python3 file_name.py`

## Assistance Functions
To view all available methods and properties of something, run 
`dir(obj)`

To add a descriptive comment to a reference type, use a multi-line string
```py
def my_func():
	"""
	The code things this is just a string
	Indent to match rest of code block
	"""
```

To read the description of a reference type, run
`help(obj)`
